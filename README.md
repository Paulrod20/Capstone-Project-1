# Capstone-Project-1
This Project is to practice what I learn with HTML and a little bit of CSS. As I continue to learn more, I will continue to add more elements to make it a complete website.

I created a landing page for my resume/portfolio using what all I have learned in HTML so far. I also created to additional pages for viewers to check out as well.
